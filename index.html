    <h2> Background info </h2>
    <p>Greta Thunberg was born on January 3rd, 2003, in Stockholm, Sweden. She is the daughter of opera singer Malena Ernman and actor Svante Thunberg. Thunberg first heard about climate change in 2011, when she was eight years old and she could not understand why so little was being done about it.. This made her depressed and as result she lost 10kg because she wasn't eating much and stopped talking for a while</p>
